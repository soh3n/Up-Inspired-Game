# Up-Inspired-Game

Game inspired by the movie UP. MIPS program utilizing the MIPS processor simulator called Mars. Using bitmap, the program draws Carl and Ellie’s house with balloons and a randomly generated cliff, appearing in different spots each time the program is run. Objective is to navigate the house to the top of the cliff using WASD keys that program processes. Once house has reached the cliff, the program plays “Married Life” utilizing MIPS syscalls 31 and 33.

## Directions
In MARS you will need two tools: the Keyboard Simulator and the Bitmap Display. Set unit height and width in pixels to be 4 and display height and width in pixels to be 256. Change the base address for display to be ($gp). Assemble and run the program, follow the directions and get Carl and Ellie's house to safety!

## Features of the Game
* Randomly generated cliff each time program runs.
* Pixel art of Carl and Ellie's house!
* MIPS generated tones that play Married Life from the move Up.
